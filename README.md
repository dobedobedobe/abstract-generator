# Abstract Generator
## A quick abstract generator for the play "They Do Not Move and other misunderstandings"

As two performers discuss jargon on stage, the abstract generator inputs abstracts from the web and creates new ones. This is projected on the screen and simultaneously printed, shredded, pulped and recycled on stage. 

Working prototype:

Install NodeJS on your device then just open the backend folder on your device and enter command: "node backend.js"

Go to your explorer and enter "localhost:8081/index.html"

Each reload will give a random abstract with changing keywords.
