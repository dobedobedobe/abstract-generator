It was implemented through the collaboration of the United Services, theHmong community, and myself.  Extensive research was conducted at the local, state, and national level involving the studying of requirements, lobbying rights, other political councils, and the needs of the refugee community. WFG research support group is now a legal non-profit organization that has held two fundraisers, released press statements, and worked with State and National political figures to address the needs of the community. 		clear	creative	boring	demanding

This study uses strains of mice with reduced genetic variation.  The two strains of mice that are the most phonetipically extreme, meaning those with the strongest and weakest voices, are crossed.  The results of this analysis can be used to find which genotypes correlate with specific voice properties like timber, pitch, and stammer.  The anticipated outcome of this lab is the identification of the genotypes that affect the voice quality in mice. The findings may be useful in establishing the unexplored application of absurdist texts in general and this text in particular. 		chosen	harmful	inventive	performing

By identifying as a subtype of Absurdism, we will eliminate the assumption that all Absurdists have the same characteristics. This will allow for more individual consideration of Absurdist texts and  people and may direct future research on the genetic factors in Absurdist writing particularly theatre texts.		additional	enthusiastic	leading	pleasant
